    7. Loop training. (No need to use DOM inputs)
<br>
   Write a DO WHILE loop that asks passengers 
   on a commuter airline if they want a window seat 
   and keeps track of their responses:
   'Do you want a window seat?  Please answer Y or N.
   <br>
   You may use inputs or just use some hardcoded values,
   for example assume that
   the flight has 8 passengers and 4 window seats. 
   Discontinue the loop when all the window seats are taken. 
   After the loop ends, display the number 
   of window seats taken and 
   the number of passengers questioned.
