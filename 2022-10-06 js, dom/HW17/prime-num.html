        Is it a PRIME number?
   Put it into mango/your-name/prime-num dir.
<br>
   The user should enter a number into an input field.
   By clicking the button the user should get the answer,
   if the number is prime or not.
<br>
   Prime numbers are the numbers that are dividable by 
   one and by themselves only, like 17, 29.
   2 - is the smallest prime number.
   Not 0 and not 1 are not considered prime numbers.
   Negative and not integer numbers are not valid input.
<br>
   Check if the input number is valid and is not 1 or 0,
   and after that use loop to check if the number 
   is dividable by some number except of 1 and itself.
<br>
   Try to make the loop as short as possible.
<br>
   Put the project into the dir digi/your-name/prime-number
<br>
   Good luck!
