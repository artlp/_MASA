1. Regular expressions.(Reminder: ^-beginning of the line, $-end of the line,
[^]-negation)

let proverb = "Opportunity did not nock until I built a door";

Use replace() 
 a) Insert ** in the beginning of line.
 b) If there is no . ! or ? at the end of line, put dot.

2. Continue your NodeJS project:
   Take Cookbook.txt, and follow it's steps to continue your project 
   for the theme you've chosen

3. Finish soccer-manager player.js functions and create 
   appropriate routing at soccer.js

4. Optional projects:
      A. random + turn by turn game 

         i) Pig game - throw two dices several times,
            stop the turn, keep the score. 
            If you get 7 - your turn stops, and at this turn 
            you'll get 0.
            Ensure the rules at Wikipedy.

         ii) Dreidel (we're going to selebrate 
             Hanukka in several weeks!) - check 
             the rules at Wikipedy

      B. event.target + event propagation

         i) Take the drum kit files. 
            Make the audio file to make sounds 
            on mouse click on the buttons in the page 
            (one listener for them all)

         ii) Create "memory game". Use 1 listener 
             for all the cards together.
             You can use memory-game-start files.
             Use flip-card as an example for 
             flipping cards.
