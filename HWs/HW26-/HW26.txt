1. Continue the project "Hangman"

2.     <!-- Timers . Create an app with the next properties:
   a) User enters a maximum(positive integer), step(small positive integer), interval time (in milliseconds) and sleep time (in milliseconds)
   b) The app starts showing numbers, starting from 0 and making "steps"
   c) The time between showing numbers is the "interval time"
   d) When getting to the maximum, the app starts showing numbers in the reverse order, from the maximum
   e) While showing numbers, the app waits for the period of the "sleep time" and changes the color of the body (once)

   More Challenge

   f) There is a button that enables the user to stop and to revert showing order of numbers by click, so showing the numbers stops and reverses at the maximum or by click
   g) Showing numbers goes up and down up and down (by the rules of "f)" ) - and can be stopped only by another button
   h) When changing direction - each time the app waits for the period of the "sleep time" and changes the color of the body
   i) The numbers are sit in a DIV that is positioned ABSOLUTE and it's LEFT or RIGHT is changed in accordance with the number value (you can wait with "i" for tomorrow - we study position ABSOLUTE tomorrow)
 -->
    <label for="max">Enter maximal number:</label>
    <input type="number" id="max" value="17">
    <label for="step">Enter step:</label>
    <input type="number" id="step" value="3">
    <label for="interval">Enter interval time:</label>
    <input type="number" id="interval" value="2000">
    <label for="sleep">Enter sleep time:</label>
    <input type="number" id="sleep" value="4000">
    <br><br>
    <button class="btn start">Start</button>
    <br><br>
    <div class="output">0</div>

3. Train objects and arrays. 
   Create 4 objects - of furniture pieces.
      Each one should have name, height (in meters)
      and method that converts the height from 
      meters to centimeters.
      Put all the objects into an array.
      Go with forEach over the array and convert
      the height of each object into centimeters.

4. Interesting use of switch.
   a) Check the interesting use of switch at
      switch-interesting-use.html and switch-interesting-use.js

   b) Now yourself use switch in the same way.
      Create function that gets person's age and answers for somebody who is 
      6 years old: You can study 
      12 years old: You can study, work
      17 years old: You can study, work, drive a car
      18 years old: You can study, work, drive a car, drink alcohol
      60 years old: You can study, work, drive a car, drink alcohol, study Kabbalah
      
      Otherwise: Wrong input

5. NodeJS.

Example of reading from file synchronously:
const txtInput = fs.readFileSync('text-to-read.txt','utf8');

The first parameter is the file name, the second is encoding.
The function fs.readFileSync() returns the text from the file.

a) Read from the file input.txt into a variable 
b) Write the text from the variable into new-text.txt
c) Write the same text again into new-text.txt
d) Check that the text appears only once in new-text.txt
e) Write the text from the variable into text-again.txt
f) Use fs.appendFileSync() to really append the text to text-again.txt
g) Check that the text appears twice now in text-again.txt
h) Read the text again from any of the files, but without encoding
i) Write the text that was read at h) into without-utf8.txt
j) How the text appears in without-utf8.txt?
