1. Use updated event-target.html.
   Continue event-target.js - add 
   listener to .red-container to show 
   one more stage of the event propagation.

2. Start the project "Hangman".
   Step 1
   a) Create an array of words for the game.
   b) When the player clicks "Start", the 
      program will choose a word from the array 
      and show it's first and last letter
      and underscores instead of other letters.
   c) Create a function that checks if a character is
      contained in the word. 
   d) Create a set of 5 buttons with letters: 
      A, B, C, D, E.
   e) When the user clicks one of the letters, 
      there should be a message like "This letter is
      in the word", "This letter is not in the word"
      Use event propagation to create only one listener!

3. Use updated timers.html. 
   Continue timers.js that we've created.

   No listeners! 
   When the script is uploading,
   sleep for the  ? of the seconds from 
   the input and after the sleep 
   write in the output "Slept well for ? seconds"

   We'll continue tomorrow with more timers.

4. NodeJS.

   Create only js file (in the dir "nodejs")

   In the file should be "triangle" function 
   that gets a number and shows at the 
   console the number triangle with this number
   of lines, like, for 5, show 

       1 
      1 2
     1 2 3
    1 2 3 4 
   1 2 3 4 5

   Run this function with the parameter 5.

   Run the script from the command line 
   with nodejs command.
