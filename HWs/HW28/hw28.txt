HOMEWORK for now (cannot send a file):
1. Recursion.
   a) Make a function that gets a number 
      and finds the sum of all the numbers from 1
      to this number 

   b) Like a, but it should be the sum of all 
      the even numbers from 1 to this number

   c) Make a function that gets a number 
      and creates a string from this number till 1
      like 5 4 3 2 1
