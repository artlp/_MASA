1. Nim Game project - Optional - Mode 3-4

2. Use more-events.css and more-events.html

        a) Create function showEvent, which shows in the output  statements like this
           "This is a <event-type> event. Value = <value>"

           The function should show the whole event on the console too.

            For <event-type> use event propety "type",
            for <value> use event.target property "value".

        b) Add listeners that will run this function for the event "input" on userInp,
                for the event "change" on userPass,
                for the event "blur" on birthYearInp

        c) Create function changeColor that exchanges class "blue" by class "red" 
           of the target element if it has class "blue", and vice versa.

        d) Add listeners that will run this function for the event "click" on 
           btn and btn1

4. Dani plays the game "Endless Dangers". 

   At the beginning each player has some amount of bullets and several grenades.
   Example:
   var ammoDani = 140
   var grDani = 4 
   var daniIsAlive = true

   There could be two dangers for the player in the game:

   1) "Dragon attack" - dragon could be killed by 4 bullets or 1 grenade

   2) "Hostile armored carriage attack" - armored carriage could be destroyed
      by 2 grenades with probability 1/2

   Example of game scenario:

      1st danger - the player is threatened by 6 dragons

      2nd danger - the player is threatened by 4 dragons

      3rd danger - the player is threatened by hostile armored carriage

      etc.

   Create function dragons(dragonNum) - it gets the amount of dragons. 
   The function subtracts bullets or/and grenades of the player,
   and if there was anough to win all the dragons, returns true
   (anounces that the player is alive), otherwise - false. 

   Create function hostileCarriage() - 
   it does not get parameters. The function subtracts the number 
   of the player grenades by 2 (if they has) and runs the function
   Math.random().
   If there was not enough grenades or the function  Math.random()
   returned number less than 0.5 - the carriage is not destroyed
   and the player dies. 
   The function returns the player's state.

   Create function gameScenario() - it gets or the string "dragons"
   and a number, or the string "carriage" and null.
   In the first case it runs the function "dragons()" and passes into it 
   the number of the dragons.

   In the second case it runs the function hostileCarriage(). 
   
   Before playing the next part of the scenario the function gameScenario 
   checks if the status of the player is "alive" or the game has ended.

   Create array gameFlow, for example,
   var gameFlow = ['dragons','dragons','carriage','dragons','carriage','carriage'];

   Go over it with "forEach" cycle and run for each element gameScenario()
   with an appropriate parameter ('dragons' or 'carriage').
   In the case of "dragons" the cycle should run Math.random()
   and get the number of the dragons from 0 and till the maximum (for example, till 7)
   - this before running gameScenario("dragons",...).

   This way the player will go through different gaming scenarios.

   Optionally: make a project from this exercise. Illustrate the game by DOM elements.
