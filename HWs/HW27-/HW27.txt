1. Continue the project "Hangman". Finish the logic
   of the game. Add the part of drawing the hangman 
   each time when the player is wrong. 
   How would you prevent the player from clicking 
   on the letters we've already checked?

2. Use position: absolute; and position: relative;
   and create your own abstract masterpiece like 
   we've created in the class. Example: abstract-masterpice.png

3. Async functions.

   Use dir "to-read".
   a) Use fs.readdir() to read the list of the filenames into array.
   b) Create new dir "to-write".
   Use the next example to recreate it if needed:

   fs.mkdir(dirIn,(err)=>{
    
    if (err) {
        
        if (err.message.search('file already exists')>-1) {
            fs.rmdir(dirIn,{recursive:true},(err)=>{
                if (err) console.log(err)
                else console.log('rmdir succeeded ☠️')
            })
        } else {
            console.log(err)
        }

   c) Go over the array of the filenames, read them
   and create them inside the dir "to-write"

4. NEW PROJECT. String Games.
Use string-games-start.
There are 6 parts. Check script.js - it contains 
T.B.D. for each part. 
Finish the part "CLOCK" and the part "QUOTES".

5. Training. Timers-buttons-objects. level09.txt
