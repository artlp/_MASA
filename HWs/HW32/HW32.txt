1. Regular expressions 

a) const ar1 = ['cat','cater','concatenation','dog','dogma','scates','catamaran','catapult','tomcat','tomdog']
Go over ar1 and create 3 new arrays: 

   1 - containing all the strings from ar1, starting with "cat"
   2 - containing all the strings from ar1, ending with "cat"
   3 - containing all the strings from ar1, equal to "cat"

b) let ar2 = ['surrender', 'unicorn', 'newer', 'door', 'empty', 'eel', 'pest']

  Create new array from ar2. If the original word ended with
  "er", it should end now with "est" instead. If the original word ended
  with "t", it should now end with "d" instead. All other words
  should be copied as is.

c) let ar3 = ['live','arrange','render','sist','place','send']
   let ar4 = ['cat','hack','develop','serv','ston']

   Use replace() and regular expressions. Add to all the words 
   of ar3 "re" at the beginning. Add to all the words of ar4 
   "er" at the end.

d)  Create function checkSentence(str) that checks that the given string looks like a sentence:
        - remove all the whitespaces from the beginning and the end
        - check that the sentence starts with an uppercase English letter
        - check that the sentence ends with a dot or exclamation or question sign
        - return true or false

        Create function testing(ar1,ar2) that goes over "inputs", 
        tries checkSentence() and checks if the output is as expected
        (in outputs). If all the outputs are as expected, conclude 
        that checkSentence() is good function.

  const inputs = ['\t\t Quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. ','','\n\t  ','Broken crayons still color.',"I don't know ",'what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.',"Are you insane?!  ","?","   \nHave you ever been to Paris?"]
  const outputs = [true,false,false,true,false,false,true,false,true]
