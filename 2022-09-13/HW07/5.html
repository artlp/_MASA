            5. Get person's height and weight.
            Use switch(true).

            Respond to the person's combination of height
            and weight (define your ranges), for example:

            If the person is taller than 180 and weights less than 90,
            say "You're tall, you should eat more".
            If the height is between 160 and 170 and the weight is less
            than 80, say "You're height is great, why you're
            speaking about your weight?", etc.</p>
        <script>
            var height = +prompt("Enter your height in cm");
            var weight = +prompt("Enter your weight in kg");

            switch (true) {
                case height >= 200 && weight >= 120:
                    console.log("wow you're huge");
                    break;
                case height >= 200 && weight < 120:
                    console.log("you are a tall person");
                    break;
                case height <= 170 && weight < 70:
                    console.log("You're normal");
                    break;
