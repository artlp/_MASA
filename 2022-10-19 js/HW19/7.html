        <p>7. Guessing game.
            <br>
            const animals = ['mouse','dragon','fly', 'parrot','rat','cat','dog','wolf','fox'];
            <br>
            Show the list of the animals in the screen.
            When the user clicks the button "play"
            run the function that randomly choses one of the animals.
            Show question like: "I thought about one animals from the list. Guess which?"
            <br>
            The user should write his guess in the input and click the button "Guess".
            <br>
            If the guess is wrong, change color of something in the screen
            to some random grey color (reminder: the colors are grey when the values
            of r g and b in rgb() are the same, like rgb(10,10,10)),
            <br>
            if the guess is right, change color of something in the screen
            to some random color and remove the listener from the "guess" button.

            <br>
            Challenges: <br>
            - keep score <br>
            - allow the user to play several times, for example by
            removing the listener from the "play" button when the user should guess
            an animal and adding it again when the machine should choose new animal <br>
            - when the user guesses an animal, show it's picture
        </p>
