        <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's
            a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
            <br>
            Jack would really like...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>Anything pokemon</li>
            <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://toysrus.com">toysRus</a> and <a href="https://etoys.com">eToys</a>.</p>
