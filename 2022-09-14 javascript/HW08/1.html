    <p style="width: 40%;">1. Ternary operator inside ternary operator.
<br>
        a) Ask user to enter a number. Your output should be: "x < 70" 
           or "x > 210" or "x is between 70 and 210".
           <br>
           CHALLENGE: With more ternary operators inside. Check if 
                      there is any input. Check if the input is numeric.
                      <br>
        b) Ask the user to enter his name (one variable) 
           and family name (another variable) and say 
           that you're happy to see him if his name is John Smith, 
           Jane Smith or Jack Daniels, otherwise tell him "go away".
           <br>
           Check that the user enters not empty string and not null 
           (when clicking on "Cancel")</p>
           <script>
            var number = prompt("Enter a random number");
            number === '' || number === null || isNaN(number) || number === 'undefined' ? console.log("It's not a number") :
                number < 70 ? console.log(`${number} < 70`) :
                number > 210 ? console.log(`${number} > 210`) : console.log(`${number} is between 70 and 210`);
