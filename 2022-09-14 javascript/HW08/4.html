        <p style="width: 40%;">4. Calculate age. Write function that gets a birth year
            of a person, birth month and birth day,
            gets the current date by the next statements:
            <br>
            var currDate = new Date();<br>
            var currYear = currDate.getFullYear();<br>
            var currMonth = currDate.getMonth();<br>
            var currDay = currDate.getDate();<br>
            <br>
            and returns the age of the person. Pay attention that getMonth()
            returns month number (0 - January, 1 - February, 2 - March, etc.),
            so you may make month input by number too.
            <script>
                var currDate = new Date();
                var currYear = currDate.getFullYear();
                var currMonth = currDate.getMonth() + 1;
                var currDay = currDate.getDate();
                console.log(currDate, currYear, currMonth, currDay);
                function birthdayCalc() {
                    var birthYear = +prompt("Enter the year you were born");
                    var birthMonth = +prompt("Enter the month you were born");
                    var birthDay = +prompt("Enter the day you were born");
                    if (birthDay > 31 || birthMonth > 12 || birthYear > currYear) {
