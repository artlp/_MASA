        <p>1. Birthdays. Get day, month and year of birth for two persons.
            (No need to make all the prompts,
            you can just set them like this:

            var year1=1999, year2=1998, month1="May", month2="May",
            day1=22, day2=22)

            If they were born on the same day, the program says:
            You both were born on the same day exactly!
            If they were born on the same day but in different years,
            the program says: you've got the same birth date!</p>
        <script>
            var year1 = 1999, year2 = 1998, month1 = "May", month2 = "May",
                day1 = 22, day2 = 22;
            if ((year1 === year2) && (month1 === month2) && (day1 === day2)) { 
                 console.log("You both were born on the same day exactly!") ;
        } else if ((month1 === month2) && (day1 === day2)) {
            console.log("You've got the same birth date!");
        } else {
            console.log("You don't share any dates");
        }
        </script>
    </body>
