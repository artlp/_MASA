        <p>Ternary operator

            a) Create a function makeDecision(), that asks what
            the user has decided (Y/N).

            Use variable "action" and ternary operator.
            If the decision is 'Y', fill the variable "action"
            with the value
            "do it", otherwise - with the value "don't do it".
            The function should log the action to the console.

            Examples:
            makeDecision() asks for the decision and gets 'Y',
            the output:
            "Do it"

            makeDecision() asks for the decision and gets 'N',
            the output:
            "Don't do it"

            b) Create a function checkPassed() that asks a student about
            the exam grade. Create "result"
            variable. Use ternary operator to check
            if the grade is greater than 60 and then put "passed"
            into the "result" variable, otherwise put "failed"
            into the "result" variable.
            Conclude with the next sentence:

            console.log(`You ${result} the exam.`);

            We assume that the input is always valid, and it is
            an integer from 0 to 100.

            Examples:
            checkPassed() asks for a grade, gets 60,
            shows "You failed the exam."

            checkPassed() asks for a grade, gets 77,
            shows "You passed the exam."

            checkPassed() asks for a grade, gets 31,
            shows "You failed the exam."

            c) Add to a) ternary operator inside to react to the option
            when the answer is not Y and not N

            d) Add to b) ternary operator inside to react to the option
            when the grade is not in the range between 0 and 100

            e) Ask user which color is her car.
            If it is blue, tell her: "Like a sky", if it is red, tell her:
            "It suits your eyes"

            f) Ask user which color and what company is her car.
            If it is blue, tell her: "Like a sky", if it is red,
            check which company it is, and if it is 'Toyota",
            tell her: "Like a sun on Japanese flag". If it is not,
            tell her: "Like a tomato"</p>

            }
            makeDecision();

            function checkPassed(result) {
                (result > 60) && (result <= 100) ? console.log("you passed") :
                    (result >= 1) && (result <= 60) ? console.log("you failed") :
