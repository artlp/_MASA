                6. Loop inside loop. Write a function "memorizeOrder" that gets
                as an argument some array that should be
                learnt by heart in accordance with the order of its members.
            </h2>

            For example. The user have to learn by heart the order of the planets.
            The function gets the array
            planets = ['Mercury','Venus','Earth','Mars','Jupiter','Saturn','Uranus','Neptune']

            Example:
            the program asks "Which planet is number 1?"
            It continues to ask the same question until the player says "Mercury".
            Now the program asks "Which planet is number 2?"
            And continues to ask this question until the user says "Venus".

            You may envelope the whole program in the outer loop that will
            repeat the whole process n times. */
